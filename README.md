# Compressed_SVD
TO DO:  
   - [x]Build Dataset: Mnist and Cifar10  
   - [x]Implement MLP with Numpy  
   - [x]Implement L2 norm in MLP with Numpy
   - [x]Implement Truncated SVD algorithm Numpy    
   - [x]Train MLP  
   - [ ]Compress MLP with Truncated SVD(Try different K), recover each layer: W=W_k  
   - [ ]Compress MLP with Truncated SVD(Try different K), recover each layer: W_1=U_k, W_2=V_k (one layer becomes two)  
   - [ ]Set a thresh hold: lambda, range over the weight in each layer, weight=0(where abs(weight)<lambda), repeat the process  d  
   - [ ]Compare the accuracy,running time and storage with each of the compression methods.
